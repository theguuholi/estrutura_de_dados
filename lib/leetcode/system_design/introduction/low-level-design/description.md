# What LLD Means?

Digs deeper into HLD

Covers a sub-system

optimisations within the sub-system

examples 
- design a parking lot
-  ubers pricing service


# Expectations


### Requirements 

-- fulfils FRs and NFRs
-- Good code structure

# Approach


1. Requirements
-- functional
-- non-functional 

2. Code
-- interfaces
-- class diagrams
-- entities
-- data model
-- design patterns

3. Quality
-- working code

HLD vs LLD
Now that we understand how to approach a LLD interview, let us look at the differences between HLD and LLD.

Where HLD focuses on the overall architecture of the system, LLD focuses on the implementation of a particular subsystem. In HLD, we focused on breaking down the system into microservices, figuring out how these services interact, and identifying the most suitable database for the system. In LLD, on the other hand, we focus on a single subsystem, optimizations within that subsystem, interfaces and classes used by the subsystem, and a working code.

So thatâ€™s it folks. This step-by-step approach should help you structure your next LLD interview.
